While we are secretly working on secret product we decided to update UDID.io and add one easy to use and quite useful feature.

We had added "Send UDID via E-mail" button which you can customize and provide your own e-mail.
So any user who received link like that "http://udid.io/?mail=your@mail.com" will send letter containing his device UDID
to your e-mail.

Did you know? [UDID.io](http://udid.io/) shows securely not only UDID, but Serial No., Product ID and IMEI of Apple's devices.
[Go and try UDID.io](http://udid.io/)!
