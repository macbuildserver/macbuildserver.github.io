Last week the load on our service was growing exponentially. At this moment service may lag or even fail with "Unknown error has occured" message. Don't worry and be patient, try to repeat your request few minutes later. 

We are working on resolving the problem. New Mac servers are coming and we're doing our hacks and fixes to increase capacity and reduce latency time on cloning repos and running build. We're sorry for inconvenience. [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/macbuildserver) to be hip to the latest updates.
